### Session - 37 Task

# NodeJS - File System

Project Brief:
  Its a simple API File System that generates a text file with a content of timestamp.
  Both the file name and its content is the time at which the text file is generated by the API.

For creating and viewing the text file:
API Front-end  :  https://madhan-api-file-system.netlify.app/

For getting the created files:
Backend in Render.com : https://session-37.onrender.com/files

Check the API end points in POSTMAN TOOL :

POST METHOD : https://session-37.onrender.com/create-file
GET METHOD : https://session-37.onrender.com/files

REMEMBER : The API end points will only work in their respective post/get method, it wont work simply by copy-pasting in the browser.
